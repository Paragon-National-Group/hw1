# Paragon National Group Spring 2022
# Computer Science / Data Science Track
# HW 1

# Assigned: March 29, 2022
# Due: April 5, 2022 6:00pm

# This is the first programming assignment of the computer science track.
# For each function, a skeleton is provided, where your job is to fill the *TODO* out.
# The questions will cover the topics learned in the first lecture, which entailed
# print statements, various data types, variables, basic operations, and conditionals.

# This function prints out a sentence saying "Welcome to the start of the PNG CS
# track"
def print_welcome_message():
    print('TODO')

# This function takes the number of cents as an argument and prints the best 
# combination of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies in descending order of
# importance (i.e. 25 cents can be split into 25 pennies, but quarters is more
# important, thus it would be split into 1 quarter). Assume that the argument given
# is non-negative.
# Ex) split_change(1) -> 0 quarters, 0 dimes, 0 nickels, 1 penny
#     split_change(20) -> 0 quarters, 2 dimes, 0 nickels, 0 pennies
#     split_change(67) -> 2 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickel, 2 pennies 
def split_change(cents):
    print('TODO')

# This function takes two strings as arguments and returns the concatenated
# string. Assume that the strings provided do not have trailing or leading 
# whitespaces. This means you have to add the whitespace in between the two
# strings yourself. The code MUST utilize variables. 
# Ex) concatenate_strings('I love', 'coding!') -> 'I love coding!'
#     concatenate_strings('Paragon', 'National Group') -> 'Paragon National Group'
def concatenate_strings(s1, s2):
    #TODO
    return

# This function takes five strings (the strings can only either be 'H', 'h', 'T'
# or 't') as arguments and returns the number of heads as an integer. Assume that
# no other strings can be inputted other than those four types.
# Ex) number_of_heads('H', 'h', 'H', 'H', 'h') -> 5
#     number_of_heads('H', 'T', 'H', 't', 'H') -> 3
#     number_of_heads('T', 't', 'h', 'h', 'H') -> 3
def number_of_heads(s1, s2, s3, s4, s5):
    #TODO
    return
