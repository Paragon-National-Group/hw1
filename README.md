# HW1
This is the first programming assignment of the computer science track. The questions will cover the topics learned in the first lecture, which entailed print statements, various data types, variables, basic operations, and conditionals.

Carefully read over the specifications of each function that is given in the header description.

# Tasks
**print_welcome_message**

This is the first task, which introduces the notion of print statements. This function prints out a sentence saying "Welcome to the start of the PNG CS track".

**split_change**

This is the second task, which introduces the notion of basic operations using integers. This function takes the number of cents as an argument and prints the best combination of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies in descending order of importance (i.e. 25 cents can be split into 25 pennies, but quarters is more important, thus it would be split into 1 quarter). Assume that the argument given is non-negative.

**concatenate_strings**

This is the third task, which uses basic operations again and introduces the notion of variables. This function takes two strings as arguments and returns the concatenated string. Assume that the strings provided do not have trailing or leading whitespaces. This means you have to add the whitespace in between the two strings yourself. The code MUST utilize variables.

**number_of_heads**

This is the last task, which introduces conditionals. This function takes five strings (the strings can only either be 'H', 'h', 'T', or 't') as arguments and returns the number of heads as an integer. Assume that no other strings can be inputted other than those four types.
